Optical character recognition is a popular subject area and its applications are found in many places such as in language translation apps that allows you to take a picture of some text and will translate that text for you. With the wide array of applications that uses optical character recognition, it seems that this area has been mostly solved. Aside from recognizing texts, optical music sheet detection appears to pose quite a challenge still as it hasnâ€™t received as much exposure due to the seemingly lack of demand for such applications. The complexity of how music is written and structured posses a great challenge.
In this project we will attempt to tackle the task of recognizing notes from an image of a sheet music and also transform the recognized notes into a midi file which can play back the music. We take this opportunity to apply our knowledge so far obtained in computer vision to explore the intricacies of sheet music and discover limitations as well as solutions to optical music recognition.
